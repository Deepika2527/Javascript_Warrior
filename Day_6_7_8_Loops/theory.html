Loop: A loop in js is a structure used to repeat a block of code untill the condition is satisified

why do we need loops:

to repeat the task automatically
to reduce the code
to handle large data like array/object


Types of loops
for loop
while loop
do-while loop


for-of
for-in

forEach
map
reduce
filter
some
every




for loop: Is used when you know how many times you want to repeat the code

initalisation: start the values
condition : how long the loop should run
increment/decrement:how the loop should go??


syntax:
for(initalisation;condition;inc/dec){


}

how does the loop work:
c  : condition
p  : prints the statemnet
i/d   : ince/dec


for(let i=0;i<=5;i++){
    console.log(i);
    
}

How it works

i = 0;

cond                    print           i/d
true                       0            1
t                          1            2
T                          2            3
T                          3            4...


inilatisation and ince/decrement ()-outside;
conditon def you have to write inside the ()- if they will infinite loop

while loop: Repeate a block of code as long as the condtion is true

Unknow no of iterations
synatx is different

syntax:

initialsation
condition
inc/dec

let i=0;
while(i<=10){
 ///block of code;
 inc/dec
}




do while loop
That excutes the block of code atleast once,even if the condtyion is false

If the condition is true it repeats untill it is satisfised, false atleast once it will be rumming

do{
//code
}while(condtion);




Differnce between for,while,do-while

for                          while                          do-while
Counted loops               conditon based loops            At-least-once-exection

Break: Stops the loop instantly and exits out of the loop completely.
No futher iterations



break;

Continue:
Stop the loop for that condtion and then continue its priniting
continue;


task 1:

let salary = [1000,2000,4000,5000]
10%increment- print

task 2:
let fruits = list of fruits..
iterate


task3:
tables any 3 


task work with 2 decrements










TEMPLATE-LITERAL- `` ${}

This is also called as tstring-lietral/
 string-Interpolation-passing a varaibles - ${}
 $- Indicates an expression is coming
{}-Contains the var/expression

Es-6
why we need to use this
``- wrap the string which can be printed as a multiline




//Prompt

prompt()- This is a methos in js where it takes the inout values from th user


It show a smallpopup box
A message written inside the prompt
A box
Ok and cancel


Remember: prompt will always returns a string not a number


Exception Handling
An unexpected error that happens while a programm is running.


examples
Divide a number by undefined
A function that doesnt exists
Network error
usinag the varaible that is not decalred
JSON Parsing failure


Syntax:


try
{
//code that may cause error
   }
catch(error){
//code that handles the error
}
finally{

//Run always (optional)
}


throw
