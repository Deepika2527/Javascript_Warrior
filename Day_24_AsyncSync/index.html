<!-- 
 Synchronous - Execting the code line by line or
 One task will be finished then the second task will be exctute



This is like making a tea
boiling water
add teapowder
mil/sugar/ masala


Asynchoronus-
example
you order food/clothes
we work/we chat with friends/they will attend classes
oreder recived


Js is a single threaded language, so the asynchrounous are handled by 

callback- 
*callback hell
pyramid of doom
* promises
* asycn function



promise: Is a an object, where to handle the asynchrnus data
like fetching the data from the api's
like fecthing the data from the database.\


works with 2 things - reslove, rejected
returns us 3 thing - pending, fullfiled, rejected


synatx : 
let p = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    resolve('Sucess')/rejected('Error')

})



.then() -? - works with resolve
.catch() - reject to display the error
.finally()- However the message will be displayed
