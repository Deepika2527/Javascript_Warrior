Data types: What types of data is being stored in then varaible is called datatype.
these are classified int0 2 types


why??
to know what of dat stored, how the sdata is stored
how the data will behave
what operations we can perfome on them


    primitive datatypes                                       Non-primitive datatypes
    int/number                                                array
    string                                                    objects
    boolean                                                   Array of objects
    null
    undefined
    bigInt
    symbol


    primitive data type-
    1. which hold a single value is called  a prmitive datatype;-Homogenous
    2. Which immutable- cant chnage



    Non-Primitive
    1.Which hold a heterogenous collection of elemenyt- Differnt types
    2.These are mutable- change the vlaue



    typeOf- check what is the datatype


   Java script is Dynamically typed language

     primitive datatypes                                       
        int/number   
            -  0-n,0.890,-123,-123.4
                                                
        string   - collect of a single letter/charcter/icnding the spaces wrapped by the single ' '   or " "  
        'h' , 'hello'    , 'hello World..!!'                                        
    boolean  
        true - 1
        false   - 0                                               
    null- absence of value
    undefined -

        lack of value is called undefine- no value
      
    bigInt - n
    symbol  - Symbol()



    Non-primitive datatypes-

    objects- 
    {
       key_1 : value_1;
       key_2 : value_2
    }
    
    
    Array of objects-
   [
   
   {
   obj1 : 'objv1,
   obj2 : 'objv2'
   
   },

   {
   obj3 : 'objv3,
   obj4 : 'objv4'
   
   },
   

   
   
   ]

    array  -
    Collection of different elements - []-



    Task 1
    what is Array of object??
    create 2-3 examples on this this.
