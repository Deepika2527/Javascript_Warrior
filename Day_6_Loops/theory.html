Loop: A loop in js is a structure used to repeat a block of code untill the condition is satisified

why do we need loops:

to repeat the task automatically
to reduce the code
to handle large data like array/object


Types of loops
for loop
while loop
do-while loop


for-of
for-in

forEach
map
reduce
filter
some
every




for loop: Is used when you know how many times you want to repeat the code

initalisation: start the values
condition : how long the loop should run
increment/decrement:how the loop should go??


syntax:
for(initalisation;condition;inc/dec){


}

how does the loop work:
c  : condition
p  : prints the statemnet
i/d   : ince/dec


for(let i=0;i<=5;i++){
    console.log(i);
    
}

How it works

i = 0;

cond                    print           i/d
true                       0            1
t                          1            2
T                          2            3
T                          3            4...


inilatisation and ince/decrement ()-outside;
conditon def you have to write inside the ()- if they will infinite loop

while loop
do while loop




task 1:

let salary = [1000,2000,4000,5000]
10%increment- print

task 2:
let fruits = list of fruits..
iterate


task3:
tables any 3 


task work with 2 decrements
