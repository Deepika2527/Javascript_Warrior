Function:
A functions is a block of code which is executed only when called/Invoking
why we need to use functions

DRY-Dont Repeat Your Code
east to maintain
reduce the number of lines

keyword to define:
function  : This is a keyword to define a function
function_name: anythins\g meaningful
()- placeholder-mandatory 
{}- holds the block of code
function_name()-Invoking/calling



Rules to define function:
can contains letter
can contain $,_
cant start with numbner


Syntax of function:

function add(){
console.log("Im adding")

}
add();

Types of functions:

1.Function declaration: supporting Hositing
   function add(){
   console.log("Hello")
   }

2.Traditional function/Named function: Done

3.Function with parameters without return keyword  -Done
   parameters- These are the predefined varaibles  that are passed in the function 
   Arguments - the values that are being passed to the parameters

4.Function with default parameter without return keyword:  -Done
   default- default you will be passing the value (a=10,)

5.Function with return kewyword:    Done
return keyword-
      its return a value
      We can reusee the values that was retuned from that function
      after return keyword we should never write a any log statements
      after return{
       }- correct approc
      after return
      {
        
      } //here it js will automatically it keeps ; after return- return; -Bad way

6. Function expression-     Done
 Assigning a function to variable is called function expression
let exmp = function(){

//block of code
}



Function decalartion accepts Hositing;
Function expression doesnt accepts hositing





7. Variable function - Done
A function assigned to a varaiable is called varaible function

6. SelfInvokingfunction/IIFE-Immediately Invoking Function expression: Done

synatx:
(function(){
//block of code
})
();

HERE  THE FUNCTION IS WRAPPED IN BRACKETS AND THEN CALLED USING ();
INDIDE THE ()-THE FUNCTION WILL BE AUTIOMATICALLY CONVERTED INTO A FUNCTION EXPRESSION






7. Anonoymus function-  Done
A function without a name is called anonymous
It doesnt have its own name
its is stored in a a varaible

Timing function
setTimeOut()-Executes a function after a specific number of Milliseconds

setTimeout(function,delay,arg1, arg2)

setInterval()-
 Run the code in the interval of time
 syntax:
 setInterval(function(),delay,arg1,arg2)


Task setInterval
how to clear/stop setTimeout and setInterval


8. Call backfunction-
 A function that goes as a parameter to another function is called callback


 syntax:
 function one(callback)
 {

 //block of code
 callback()

 }

 function two()
 {
 //block of code
 }
 one(two)





9. High order function:
1. a FUNCTION THAT ACCEPTS ANOTHER FUNCTION AS A paremter is called high order function
2. we use retun
3. example- map,reduce,filter

10. Arrow function:
Es-6-
Easy and consice way to wriyt the code.



arrow functions with object -



key points
1. Arrow function with single parameter doesnt need ()
2. We can also use _ for a sinlge parameter
3.if we write {name:'Anu'}, js  thinks that {} is block and return undefined,so we need to wrap the object in a ()
4. Arrow function has its own return statemnet

synatx:

let varaible = (Parameters1,Parameter2) =>
{
  //block of code
}





11. pure/impure function

12.Recursive function



Benefits of functions
Modularity
Clean and easy 
Reusability
Maintainability

scopes
