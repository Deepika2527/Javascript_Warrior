<!-- 
 scopes:
 In javscript a scope is nothing but the lifespan of the varaible and wehere we can use it.

 Types of scopes:
 Global scope: A varaible that is difed outside the function or a block
 Local Scope : A varaible that us defined inside the function or block
 Functional scope
 Block scope

 Lexical scope:


 Blocks -{ }
 functions
 for
 if
 while



 var  -global,local
 drawback of var is, it leaks the data
 let   - global,local,block scope
 const  - global,local,block scope



 Hoisting: When the declaration part of the var moves up is called hositing
 
 Hoisting is only possible for var
 varaible hositing:
 functional hositing



 for let and const they go into temporaily dead zone
 the time  during which the varaibles are declared with let and const cannot be accessed

log(a)
 let a=10;
 let a;
 a =10;//uniintailsised stage
