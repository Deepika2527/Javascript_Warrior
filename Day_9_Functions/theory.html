Function:
A functions is a block of code which is executed only when called/Invoking
why we need to use functions

DRY-Dont Repeat Your Code
east to maintain
reduce the number of lines

keyword to define:
function  : This is a keyword to define a function
function_name: anythins\g meaningful
()- placeholder-mandatory 
{}- holds the block of code
function_name()-Invoking/calling



Rules to define function:

Syntax of function:

function add(){
console.log("Im adding")

}
add();

Types of functions:

1.Function declaration: supporting Hositing
   function add(){
   console.log("Hello")
   }

2.Traditional function/Named function: Done

3.Function with parameters without return keyword  -Done
   parameters- These are the predefined varaibles  that are passed in the function 
   Arguments - the values that are being passed to the parameters

4.Function with default parameter without return keyword:  -Done
   default- default you will be passing the value (a=10,)

5.Function with return kewyword:    Done
return keyword-
      its return a value
      We can reusee the values that was retuned from that function
      after return keyword we should never write a any log statements
      after return{
       }- correct approc
      after return
      {
        
      } //here it js will automatically it keeps ; after return- return; -Bad way

6. Function expression-     Done
 Assigning a function to variable is called function expression
let exmp = function(){

//block of code
}



Function decalartion accepts Hositing;
Function expression doesnt accepts hositing





7. Variable function - Done
A function assigned to a varaiable is called varaible function

6. SelfInvokingfunction/IIFE

7. Anonoymus function-  
A function without a name is called anonymous
It doesnt have its own name
its is stored in a a varaible


setTimeOut()-Executes a function after a specific number of Milliseconds

setTimeout(function,delay,arg1, arg2)

setInterval()-

Task setInterval
how to clear/stop setTimeout and setInterval


8. Call backfunction

9. High order function

10. Arrow function

11. pure/impure function

12.Recursive function

Modularity
Clean and easy 
Reusability
Maintainability
